## Overview
CuRveR was originally created to provide an easy to use analysis tool for killing curves assay done in microplates with Bdellovibrio bacteriovorus ([Remy, Lamot and Santin _et al_. (2022)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666166721008108)). Due to its flexible implementation, it can be used to analyse a broad range of other assays requiring to fit an equation to the data like growth curves or β-galactosidase assays.
